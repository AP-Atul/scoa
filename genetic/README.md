## Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs
to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. 
Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization
and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.

## Rosenbrock Function
It is a non-convex function used to test the performance of optimizing problems

The function is given by:
``` f(x, y) = (a - x) ^ 2 + b(y - x ^ 2) ^ 2 ```

The visualization can be achieved as::
